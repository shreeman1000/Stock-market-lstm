       "{0: 'mumbai/bangalore: the us department of labour (dol), which has reset wages upwards for h-1b workers across all four tiers or wage levels (representing the range of skills from entry level to experienced), states that it will improve the accuracy of prevailing wages paid to foreign workers, by bringing them in line with wages paid to similarly employed us workers. \\n\\nthese rules come into effect from october 8. all labour condition applications (lcas) filed on or after this date will be subject to the new and higher wage minimum standards. \\n\\ndol uses ‘occupational employment statistics’ (oes) data from the bureau of labour statistics (bls) to determine prevailing wages in a wide array of occupations. the prevailing wage rate is defined as the average wage paid to similarly employed workers in a specific occupation in the geographic area of intended employment. the oes prevailing wage is subdivided into four tiers or wage levels, representing the range of skills from entry level to experienced. \\n\\n“under the new rule, oes prevailing wage minimums will increase significantly for foreign workers at all four levels of skill and experience. for example, under current rules, the skill level i (entry level) wage minimum is set at the 17th percentile of the average wage for the occupation. when the new regulation takes effect, the entry-level minimum will increase to the 45th percentile – just under what is today the minimum salary for skill level iii,” explains mitch wexler, california based partner, at fragomen, a global immigration law firm. \\n\\nhowever, immigration attorneys are quick to point out the flaws in its rules, which run into a whopping 157 pages. for instance, it picks up the top 20 employers of h-1b workers, based on the number of labour condition applications (lcas) filed. incidentally, all these companies are in the it or ites space. \\n\\nit then goes on to say that when many of the heaviest users of the h-1b program pay wages well above the prevailing wage, it suggests that the prevailing wages are too low, and thus can be abused by other firms to replace us workers with lower-wage foreign workers… \\n\\nto illustrate, in the case of amazon the average rate at which the wage offered exceeded the prevailing wage was almost 94% and this was in 68% cases. in case of infosys, the rate was 6.53% seen in 11% cases. \\n\\ngreg siskind, founding partner at the immigration law firm of siskind susser, has tweeted, “they fail to note that a whole lot of h-1bs are filed by small employers who aren’t paying what apple, amazon and salesforce are. also, this rule affects other professions beyond the technology space, which the department of labour seems to think is the only profession impacted.” \\n\\ncharles kuck, managing partner at kuck baxter, an immigration law firm, told toi, “there will be a major impact on wages for h-1b workers, but mostly on smaller companies who generally pay closer to prevailing wages. large tech employers will not even notice this regulation.” \\n\\n“the rules substantially modify prevailing wage requirements so as to limit the availability of the h-1b visas to the most highly paid professionals, regardless of actual wage data for the labour market. the trump administration is making sweeping changes to us immigration without the regulatory process. the huge amounts of resources that have been expended in litigation as a result of anti-immigration policies by this administration is egregious and frankly wasteful,” says snehal batra, managing attorney at npz law group. \\n\\n“the employer will have to specifically request a wage from the dol, rather than select one, which will result in further delays. if the employer decides to select a wage from an independent survey, and if the requested wage turns out to be higher, the employer will have to pay the difference” explains cyrus d. mehta, new york based immigration attorney and founder of a law firm. \\n\\nin the backdrop of the pandemic, siskind points out, “the country is already experiencing a massive shortage of doctors in the middle of a pandemic and then dol drops this on us? keep in mind that 1/4th of all doctors coming out of residency programs are on visas and will be impacted by this rule big time. a huge segment of american health care employers (such as inner city community health centers and rural hospitals) can\\'t pay doctors at the salaries being contemplated!” \\n\\n\"current h-1b regulations already require employers to pay foreign workers the higher of the prevailing wage or the actual wage paid by the company. by increasing the required wages, the new rules will harm all employers trying to hire foreign workers, but especially startup companies and smaller firms who may not be able to meet the increased wage requirements,\" said stephen yale-loehr, professor of immigration law practice, at cornell law school \\n\\n\"dol and dhs justify the new rules as a way to help us workers, but they may have the opposite effect. companies may decide to offshore jobs overseas, hurting us workers. i am confident companies will challenge these new rules as overbroad and unnecessary,” he summed up.',\n",
       " 1: 'mumbai/bangalore: late on tuesday night, india time, the trump administration issued two interim final rules (ifrs) relating to the h-1b visa program (skilled worker visa), which significantly raise wage parameters and tighten eligibility norms by narrowing certain definitions ranging from ‘speciality occupation’ to ‘employer-employee relationship’. new definitions such as third-party worksite have been incorporated. the fraud detection force has also got more teeth to conduct site visits and monitor compliance before, during, and after an h1-b petition (application) is approved.the biggest blow to the it services sectors is that the new rules limit the h-1b visa tenure, where the employees are to be placed at third-party client sites to a maximum of one-year, from the current maximum tenure of three-years. in this context, cyrus d. mehta, new york based immigration attorney told toi, “the rule is a full-frontal assault on indian heritage it services companies, where h-1b employees are typically placed at third-party client sites.”these rules will result in more request for evidence (requiring additional proof to be submitted by the sponsoring employer) during the process of vetting of visa applications, which in turn will lead to delayed and costlier processing of h-1b visas and make it hiring of h-1b workers more challenging.while the largest sponsoring employers of h-1b beneficiaries include us companies, indians, those in the technology sector, who form a significant chunk of h-1b visa allottees will be disproportionally impacted, by the new rules. it will dampen the american-dream for many aspirants.in terms of numbers, according to the us citizenship and immigration services (uscis), the immigration agency of the us government, there are 5.83 lakh h-1b workers in the us. while country-wise details are not available, there were more than 3.50 lakh indians stuck in the green-card backlog in the employment category, as of november 2019. during the fiscal ended september 30, 2019, 2.78 lakh which translates to 72% of the total h-1b visas issued (both new and extensions) were given to indian beneficiaries.the entire process of issue of the ifrs was put on a fast track mode, while the avowed object is protection of american jobs in the backdrop of the pandemic, the timing, makes it seem a tactic to pander to president trump’s vote base. law suits will inevitably follow, say immigration attorneys.the interim final rule, issued by the department of homeland security (dhs), also codifies a requirement that the h-1b sponsoring employer submit evidence, such as contracts, work orders or similar evidence to establish that an employer-employee relationship exists and that the h-1b beneficiary (individual who is sponsored for the visa) will perform services in a speciality occupation at third-party worksites.it may be recalled that the us federal court had quashed a policy memo dealing with such a requirement. post which us citizenship and immigration services (uscis) had entered into a settlement with the plaintiff – it serve alliance. this order is now overturned.the dhs regulation will be published on october 8 and will take effect 60 days later – by december 6. on the other hand, the regulation on hiking the wage requirement issued by the department of labour (dol) comes in to effect from october 8, itself.a press note issued by the dhs states that while the h-1b program was intended to allow employers to fill gaps in their workforce and remain competitive in the global economy, it has now expanded far beyond that, often to the detriment of u.s. workers.data shows that the more than a half million h-1b non-immigrants in the us have been used to displace american workers. this has led to reduced wages in a number of industries in the us labour market and the stagnation of wages in certain occupations, it adds.“we have entered an era in which economic security is an integral part of homeland security. put simply, economic security is homeland security. in response, we must do everything we can within the bounds of the law to make sure the american worker is put first,” stated chad wolf, acting secretary, dhs.“the u.s. department of labour is strengthening wage protections, addressing abuses in these visa programs, and ensuring american workers are not undercut by cheaper foreign labour,” said u.s. secretary of labour eugene scalia. “these changes will strengthen our foreign worker programs and secure american workers’ opportunities for stable, good-paying jobs,” she added in the press release.however, in a strongly worded statement, linda moore, president and ceo at technet (an alliance of tech ceos) stated it will hurt american companies that depend on h-1b workers. “…changing the requirements around h-1b and other work visas will only hurt american companies that depend on high-skilled workers who fill critical positions while we work to grow our domestic stem pipeline. this new rule only harms america\\'s ability to recover from the pandemic during this critical time and has zero impact on increasing domestic american jobs.\"in its statement, nasscom pointed out that the changes announced to the h-1b visa program will restrict access to talent and will harm the american economy, endanger u. jobs, put us interests at risk, slowing down r&d into solutions to the covid crisis. it is important for the us market to be able to access skilled talent for its businesses, especially during the covid recovery phase.these regulations seem to be based on misinformation about the programme and runs counter-productive to their very objective of saving the american economy and jobs. this is particularly relevant at a time when us businesses continues to face a huge deficit of stem skills: overall u.s. unemployment rate grew from 4.1% in jan-2020 to 8.4% in august-2020; while unemployment in computer occupations declined from 3% to 2.5% in this period, it explained.in the 30-day period ending september 28, 2020, there were over 652,000 active job vacancy postings advertised online for jobs in computer occupations: up from 625,000 vacancies in the 30-day period ending may 13, 2020. that is, despite high degree of overall unemployment in us, demand for high-tech skills continues to remain robust – clearly endorsing the argument that there are just not enough workers with relevant skills to fill them. the new rules announced will worsen this talent gap by making it more difficult for us employers to hire foreign workers, summed up nasscom.',\n",
       " 2: 'tallahassee: florida gov. ron desantis extended the state\\'s voter registration deadline tuesday after he said heavy traffic crashed the state\\'s online system and potentially prevented thousands of enrolling to cast ballots in next month\\'s presidential election. several progressive groups are suing for an additional extension.desantis extended the deadline that expired monday until 7 pm. tuesday. in addition to online registration, desantis ordered elections, motor vehicle and tax collectors offices to stay open until that hour for anyone who wanted to register in person. he also said any forms postmarked by tuesday would be accepted.voting and minority rights groups responded with a federal lawsuit, saying the confusion required more time, but desantis disagreed, saying the seven-hour outage required a comparable extension. the problems began about 5 p.m. monday and continued until the midnight deadline.\"you can have the best site in the world, but sometimes there are hiccups,\\'\\' desantis said during a press conference at the villages, a large retirement community in central florida. \"if 500,000 people descend at the same time, it creates a bottleneck.\\'\\'dream defenders, new florida majority, organize florida, latinojustice prldef and others filed their lawsuit in tallahassee, saying at least two additional days were needed to give those denied access enough time to learn of the extension and respond. they said that anything less would be voter suppression.\"no voter should be denied their right to vote during a global health pandemic because florida did not have a functioning online voter registration system,\\'\\' said jorge vasquez, power and democracy director at advancement project national office, one of the suing groups. no hearing was immediately set.there were no immediate reports of major glitches during the additional period through tuesday evening that potentially allowed thousands more people to register in florida\\'s 67 counties. in leon county, for example, there were nearly 2,000 additional transactions - including new or updated registrations - by late-afternoon, county elections supervisor mark earley said.florida secretary of state laurel lee, who oversees the voting system, said that at times on monday the online registration system \"was accessed by an unprecedented 1.1 million requests per hour.\\'\\' officials said many of the requests were likely repeated attempts by those who failed to get into the system, which went online in 2017. there were complaints before the 2018 registration deadline that the system was sluggish.lee\\'s office is investigating the overload.\"at this time, we have not identified any evidence of interference or malicious activity impacting the site,\\'\\' she said in a statement tuesday night. \"we will continue to monitor the situation and provide any additional information as it develops.\\'\\'ceo matthew prince of cloudflare, the internet infrastructure company that protects florida\\'s elections website, tweeted that he has seen no indication that any voter registration systems it protects had been hit by a cyberattack. the company declined further comment.the fbi and the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency warned elections officials nationwide last week that cyberattacks could disrupt their systems during the run-up to the election. they particularly noted \"distributed denial-of-service\\'\\' attacks, which inundate a computer system with requests, potentially clogging up servers until the system becomes inaccessible to legitimate users.the volume of requests that overwhelmed the florida registration site monday was not consistent with denial-of-service attacks, which typically render websites unavailable with barrages of several hundred million requests per second.the potential for outside meddling is an especially sensitive issue in florida, a key battleground state in november\\'s election between president donald trump and his democratic challenger, former vice president joe biden. the state has lingering questions about russian hacking during the election four years ago.biden tweeted tuesday that the republican governor\\'s decision to extend the deadline \"is a win for our democracy.\\'\\'whatever caused the disruption, it threw up a roadblock for those trying to register. sarah dinkins, a florida state university student, tried to help her younger sister register monday night. they began trying about 9 p.m. and by 10:30 p.m. had not been successful.\"i feel very frustrated,\\'\\' she said. \"if the voting website doesn\\'t work, fewer people potentially democratic voters will be able to vote.\\'\\'the outage impacted many florida felons, who just received the right to vote in a 2018 state referendum that passed overwhelmingly _ if they have completed probation and don\\'t have any outstanding fines or fees. murderers and sex offenders are still banned.desmond meade, executive director of the florida rights restoration coalition, said the group heard from dozens of felons who couldn\\'t register.this is not the first major computer shutdown to affect the state government this year. for weeks in the spring, tens of thousands of floridians who lost their jobs because of the coronavirus pandemic couldn\\'t file for unemployment benefits because of repeated crashes by that overwhelmed computer system, delaying their payments. desantis replaced the director overseeing that system but blamed the problems on his predecessor, fellow republican rick scott, who is now a us senator.democrats jumped on the latest issue, saying it and the unemployment fiasco showed that the desantis administration is inept and accused it of trying to stop people from voting.\"the utter incompetence of gov. ron desantis in allowing the state\\'s voter registration website to crash on the very last day to register for the upcoming november election is, sadly, completely believable,\\'\\' us rep. debbie wasserman schultz said. \"his administrative buffoonery in operating the state\\'s unemployment system telegraphed today\\'s executive ineptitude. however, this particular blunder intimates a continuing pattern of voter suppression that the governor has become notorious for.\\'\\'',\n",
       " 3: \"washington: the fbi and the department of homeland security's cybersecurity agency have issued a series of advisories in recent weeks aimed at warning voters about problems that could surface in the election - as well as steps americans can take to counter the foreign interference threat. \\n\\nthe issues identified in the public service announcements run the gamut from the spread of online disinformation about the electoral process to cyberattacks targeting election infrastructure. taken together, the advisories make clear that american agencies are tracking a broad range of potential threats that they believe voters should know about - not just for transparency's sake but also so that voters can be prepared. \\n\\nthe warnings come even though u.s. officials as recently as tuesday expressed confidence in the integrity of the vote despite repeated efforts by president donald trump to denigrate it. \\n\\nsome of the announcements from the fbi and cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency: \\n\\n \\n\\nit's not hard to set up a fake, or spoofed, email account or website to closely resemble a legitimate one. that's precisely what the fbi and cisa are warning may take place to trick americans during the election. \\n\\ncyber criminals routinely forge websites with slight misspellings or other barely perceptively alterations to dupe internet users. \\n\\nin the context of an election, for instance, a bogus website ending in ``.com'' versus ``.gov'' that purports to have legitimate voting information or results could trick people who visit the page into thinking that what they're reading is an authentic, trustworthy government source. \\n\\nbesides spreading false information, officials say, such spoofed websites and email accounts can gather personally identifiable information and spread malicious software. \\n\\none precaution voters can take is to verify the spelling of websites and email addresses that may look legitimate but are actually not. \\n\\n \\n\\nforeign intelligence services could use websites like pseudo-academic online journals to cause confusion around the election and undermine confidence in the legitimacy of its results. \\n\\nthat could include promoting claims of voter suppression and ballot fraud, denigrating individual political candidates, disseminating information about cyberattacks _ both real and alleged _ and spreading otherwise misleading or unsubstantiated assertions to manipulate public opinion and discredit the election process. \\n\\nu.s. officials are encouraging voters to rely on trustworthy sources of information, including state and local election officials, and to verify through credible channels reports about problems about voting before recirculating them online. \\n\\n \\n\\nhow someone voted is private. but information about who is eligible to vote, how often a person votes and for which party is publicly available through a variety of sources. \\n\\nthat's why authorities said there was nothing to be concerned about last month when russian media reported that some u.s. voter registration information was available on a hacker's forum. \\n\\nthe fbi and cisa issued a reminder not long after that unnamed ``foreign actors'' and cyber criminals are spreading false information intended to discredit the american electoral process, including by falsely claiming to have hacked and leaked voter information. \\n\\neven if those foreign actors or cyber criminals had such information, it wouldn't do anything to stop an american from casting a ballot or to provide a way to manipulate the vote. the u.s. agencies say they have no information that any attack targeting election infrastructure has compromised the integrity of election results or the accuracy of voter registration information, or prevented an election from occurring. \\n\\n \\n\\nthe advisories describe possible threats to election infrastructure that they say may slow voting, or impede access to voting information, but that should not compromise the integrity of the results. \\n\\none concern relates to so-called distributed denial-of-service, or ddos, attacks in which a server gets knocked at least temporarily offline by a flood requests, which could leave election-related websites inaccessible or slow access to voting information or results. \\n\\neven in such attacks, though, the underlying voting data should not be affected, according to federal officials who say they've been working with local election counterparts to make sure they can minimize the impact and recover quickly from such a disruption. \\n\\nthe fbi and cisa say in another of the recently issued warnings that cyber actors are continuing to try to break into voter registration and vote reporting systems. but the agencies say they haven't identified any incidents that could prevent americans from voting or that could change vote tallies. \\n\\nin 2016, russia searched for vulnerabilities in state elections systems across the u.s. and also breached the illinois voter registration system, probing for access to voting machines, internal networks, voter registration system, electronic pollbooks and vote reporting websites. but there is no evidence that any votes were changed, or that the russian activity affected the outcome. \\n\\nthis year, the agencies say they believe that it would be difficult to manipulate votes in a way that could affect the election, and that election officials have developed safeguards like provisional ballots, paper backups and backup pollbooks.\",\n",

military and intelligence-the forces behind the rise of the taliban-she found herself into their crosshairs. now, pakistan is terrorizing her parents. \\n\\nveteran us diplomat alice wells had shared

called #releaseshabirbaloch, demanded that pakistan provide liberties and restore human rights for the people in the regions of balochistan, sindh and khyber pakhtunwa. besides the denial of rights and dignity, the baloch people also allege economic exploitation at the hands of pakistan which they say is colluding with china to take away the mineral resources from balochistan through the china pakistan economic corridor (cpec). \\n\\nthe baloch activists have also highlighted the activities of the secretive death squads, allegedly established by the pakistani government and the army, in balochistan to murder and kidnap people who seek better socio-economic conditions for one of pakistan\\'s most deprived regions. \\n\\nthis large-scale disaffection across vast regions of pakistan has

       " 25: 'nicosia: turkey\\'s president tayyip erdogan back in june 2018 declared that his next goal would be to make turkey a \"top ten world power\" and spoke about his country\\'s increasing influence in international affairs. \\n\\nas part of erdogan\\'s ambitions to turn his country into a superpower, turkey is actively involved in conflicts with syria and libya, tries to extend its influence into the aegean sea, is illegally drilling in cyprus\\' gas exploration blocks, accuses the uae of betraying the palestinians, and now backs azerbaijan in its war with armenia. \\n\\nbut the question is whether all these moves strengthen erdogan\\'s grandiose ambitions or actually undermine them and whether his dream of turkey acquiring a superpower status is crumbling? \\n\\nit should be mentioned that turkey has established military bases in qatar and somalia, and according to several reports, it makes efforts to establish a base in the sudanese island of suakin by the red sea and the horn of africa, where ankara, together with qatar, compete for influence against the uae and saudi arabia. \\n\\nerdogan\\'s actions instead of gaining him friends have alienated many of its strongest supporters. ankara has angered the west by trying to establish close relations with russia and even risks us sanctions with its purchase of the s400 missile defence system. but both in syria and in libya and now in nagorno- karabakh, turkey and russia support different sides in the respective wars. ankara\\'s policies have alienated it from all its former friends and currently, the only country which can be considered to be its ally in qatar. \\n\\nundoubtedly, the turkish economy is now in serious trouble -- indicative of this is the fact that according to media reports the turkish lira has lost 22 per cent of its value since the beginning of the year. but instead of trying to find ways of improving the economy, erdogan is trying to distract the public from turkey\\'s economic woes to \"national struggles\" abroad, that is, defending turkic people in other countries. \\n\\nin recent months the number covid-19 cases in the country have been rising steadily, while the head of the turkish medical association in ankara a few weeks ago accused the government of hiding the real numbers of covid-19 cases and related deaths, while doctors warned that hospitals are running out of beds as infections surge. \\n\\nit is noted that due to the pandemic a key sector of the turkish economy, that of tourism lost about one-fourth of its custom this summer. even the major gas discovery in the black sea, which is preliminarily estimated at 11.3 trillion cubic feet, cannot save turkey\\'s woeful economic outlook, as its development will take more than five years and an enormous investment to be made before gas becomes commercially viable. \\n\\nfurthermore, foreign investors who previously accounted for about 40 per cent of the bond and equity market, now account for only 5 per cent, following the downgrading by the moody\\'s rating agency of turkish bonds to \"junk\" status. \\n\\nanother strong blow on the turkish economy is the saudi embargo on turkish products imposed as from october 3, which accounts to some usd 3.3 billion a year. \\n\\nthe relations between turkey and saudi arabia have greatly deteriorated due to the policy followed by ankara in the gulf, the military operations in syria and the verbal attacks on saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman bin abdulaziz al-saud who is openly accused by the turks as ordering the assassination of saudi journalist jamal khashoggi in istanbul. \\n\\naykan erdemir, senior director of the turkey programme at the us-based foundation for the defence of democracies, has said that \"the increasing troubles facing the turkish government at home, now march alongside increasing belligerence abroad\" and reminded that \"erdogan has never shied from using force. in syria he certainly didn\\'t stop at just rhetoric,\" he pointed out. \\n\\npresident erdogan wants to portray himself as a defender of muslims in general and in the ongoing nagorno-karabakh conflict as a great sword-wielding warrior defending muslim azeris against christian armenians. the truth, however, may be different. by sending men and military hardware to azerbaijan, erdogan may be trying to exact revenge on armenians who for decades have annoyed ankara, by demanding the recognition of the armenian genocide by ottoman turks back in 1914-1923. \\n\\nfrench president emmanuel macron on october 2 demanded that turkey explained what he said was the arrival of jihadist fighters in azerbaijan and urged his partners in nato to face up to the behaviour of the actions of their ally. \\n\\nso far erdogan has successfully deflected turkish public opinion from the burning issues of the time, by keeping the population on the edge and getting them rally round the flag. the question, however, is for how long can he implement these tactics?
